# Kardashev

Kardashev is a (yet another) sandbox voxel game based, this time based around technological progression and physics.

## TODO

- [ ] Create an event hookup system so systems can listen for specific events.
- [ ] Start implementing benchmarking tools, tests.
- [ ] Optimise meshes so we have one mesh per chunk and not one mesh per voxel.
- [ ] Actually make some world generation, and not just perlin noise in all axes.
- [ ] Introduce physics and new controllers.
- [ ] Basic GUI stuff
- [ ] Add a menu now that you have text rendering.
- [ ] Begin work on world generation based on planets.
- [ ] Once all of the above is done, add networking so players can send seeds to one another and walk around on small sample planets.
